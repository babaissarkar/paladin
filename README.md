# PRPlayer
A cross-platform CCG/TCG playtester written completely in Java.

# Building
Clone the repository, then run
  `mvn package`
# Running
Download the latest release, then run the `.jar` file. You will need the latest Java Runtime (JRE).

# Quick Start Guide
1. Install and launch the program. Create a new Deck (preferably 2) using the Deck Editor. **Actions > Deck Editor**
2. Start a new Game. **Actions > Start/Restart Game**
3. In the new window, select the decks for Player 1 and Player 2. Optionally, you can change the Java theme. Set other properties. (Flipped Cards -> Initial cards that are put into the Battle Zone face down at the start of the game. Barrier Points -> Life points.)
4. Click OK, then click Yes twice. You should now be able to see Player 1's hand. Many actions can be done by right clicking on the Cards or Deck or Graveyard. Move cards by clicking on the card and then clicking on the destination square. Rotate cards by the right click menu or mouse wheel scroll.
5. When you are finished with your turn, click **Actions > End Current Turn**. This will end your turn and will show the 2nd player's hand.
